Angostura 1824 Limited Reserve is a blend of the finest matured vintage rum handpicked by The Master Blender among selected barrels . These have been stored in American oak barrels for at least 12 years, and then gently and artisanally mixed before they re-casked into a new barrel. 

When the rum reaches its optimal ripeness it is filtered and bottled, all by hand.

The name comes from the year 1824 when Dr. Siegert developed his Angostura bitters and created the foundation for Spirit Group Angostura.
